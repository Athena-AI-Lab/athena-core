- "📥 Find the top 3 most-starred Python repositories on GitHub this week and summarize what each does"
- "🔎 Search Hacker News for posts about 'LangChain' and summarize the top 3 discussions"
- "📊 Plot the MACD and RSI for TSLA over the last week"
- "🌐 Go to TechCrunch and extract the latest 5 tech news headlines"
- "📚 Scrape the top 10 books from the New York Times Best Sellers list and generate a reading list"
- "🗺️ Get the current weather in Tokyo and tell me the best time to visit this week"
